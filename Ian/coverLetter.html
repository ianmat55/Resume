	<p> Dear Hiring Manager, </p>
	<br>
	<p> My name is Ian Matsumoto. I am a GIS Analyst, freelancer and programmer. Travelling to the Bay Area from my hometown of Honolulu HI, 
	    I am pursuing my passion for creative innovation through a career in technology. Carrying 5+ years of experience with GIS
	    technologies, a love for computer science, and an exceptional work ethic I believe I can be a valuable asset to Kevala team. </p>
	<br>
	<p> The Carbon Analyst position appeals to my love of Environmental Science and my professional passion for computer science and mathematics. I have had 
	    a brief introductory experience involving carbon sequestration data during my volunteer work at the Mamoni Valley Preserve, and would be very excited
	    to turn that into a long term position. I have intermediate experience with Python programming possesing just over one year of experience and am currently tutoring 
	    special needs kids on the subject. I also have beginner experience with web development and Java programming. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
	    If you would consider me for this position, it would be a long term investment considering that I wholly believe in the mission statement,
	    pushing for environmental sustainability and would ideally like to base my career on enviromental sustainabiliy through technology. 
	    Working at Tesla, I have had first hand expereince of this new wave of electronic vehicles and the slow transition 
	    away from fossil fuels. You can reach me by phone outside of normal 9PM - 5PM office hours and by email anytime. I look foward to hearing back from you. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<p> Thank you for the consideration, </p>
	<br>
	<p> Ian Matsumoto </p>
