Dear Hiring Manager,

I am seeking opportunities to further build my career and gain meaningful experience as a web developer. I have intermediate experience with SQL, Python, JavaScript and app development. I do not have previous job experience as a programmer, but I can guarantee that I am a very fast learner and motivated self-starter. As a self-taught programmer, I feel like I am a good fit for this company and believe in its mission statement. Here is a link to my Github for my current projects: https://github.com/ianmat55. Please take a moment to review my enclosed resume as well as my application. I appreciate the evaluation of my credentials and look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Ian Matsumoto
